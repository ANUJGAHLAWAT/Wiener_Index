# Wiener_Index
To calculate Wiener index for acyclic compound from smile notation in c++ language
Wiener index (also Wiener number) is a topological index of a molecule, defined as the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths between all
pairs of vertices in the chemical graph representing the non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule.
In this program, I had calculated it by reading smile with conditions like if it gets bracket then it has to do these things. Likewise, I
have calculated the Wiener index for the acyclic compound.

Future Plan:
1. We can make it workable for cyclic one also.
